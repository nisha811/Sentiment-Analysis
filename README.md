# Sentiment-Analysis

Introduction

This project touches upon various aspects of sentiment analysis and ways to visualize them and understand them. These concepts are applied on live tweets that were extracted in the month of April, 2018. The topic chosen is warfare, real and imaginary. The civil war currently happening in Syria is a topic of discussion for every news channel and so are entertainment news about movies like the Avengers Movie. The #SyrianWar captures sentiments of people across the globe and emotions that people are going through. The #AvengersInfinityWar is a more light-hearted but much awaited topic of discussion amongst movie fanatics across the world. The analysis is done over the following steps:


Step 1: Extraction of 1000 tweets from each “hashtag” which totals up to 2000 live tweets.

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Step 3: Building unigrams, bigrams and trigrams word clouds from the top 200 keywords caught from the tweets

Step 4: Building a TF-IDF word cloud from the TF-IDF matrix

Step 5: Measuring the path of the sentiments across these tweets with the help of lexicons

Step 6: Building a commonality and comparison word cloud from the two topics

Step 7: Creating an NRC Radar chart to measure the emotions across the tweets

Step 1 alone is perfomed on Python using it's TWEEPY library and the rest of the steps are done on R
